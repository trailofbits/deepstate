# DeepState

[![Slack Chat](http://empireslacking.herokuapp.com/badge.svg)](https://empireslacking.herokuapp.com/)

DeepState is a framework that provides C and C++ developers with a common interface to various symbolic execution and fuzzing engines. Users can write one test harness using a Google Test-like API, then execute it using multiple backends without having to learn the complexities of the underlying engines. It supports writing unit tests and API sequence tests, as well as automatic test generation. Read more about the goals and design of DeepState in our [paper](https://www.cefns.nau.edu/~adg326/bar18.pdf).

## Supported Platforms

DeepState currently targets Linux, with macOS support in progress.

## Dependencies

Build:

- CMake
- GCC with multilib support
- Python 2.7
- Setuptools

Runtime:

- Python 2.7
- Z3 (for the Manticore backend)

## Building on Ubuntu 16.04 (Xenial)

```shell
$ sudo apt update && sudo apt-get install build-essential gcc-multilib cmake python python-setuptools
$ git clone https://github.com/trailofbits/deepstate deepstate
$ mkdir deepstate/build && cd deepstate/build
$ cmake ../
$ make
```

## Installing

Assuming the DeepState build resides in `$DEEPSTATE`, run the following commands to install the DeepState python package:

```shell
$ virtualenv venv
$ . venv/bin/activate
$ python $DEEPSTATE/build/setup.py install
```

The `virtualenv`-enabled `$PATH` should now include two executables: `deepstate` and `deepstate-angr`. These are _executors_, which are used to run DeepState test binaries with specific backends (automatically installed as Python dependencies). The `deepstate` executor uses the Manticore backend while `deepstate-angr` uses angr. They share a common interface where you may specify a number of workers and an output directory for saving backend-generated test cases.

You can check your build using the test binaries that were (by default) built and emitted to `deepstate/build/examples`. For example, to use angr to symbolically execute the `IntegerOverflow` test harness with 4 workers, saving generated test cases in a directory called `out`, you would invoke:

```shell
$ deepstate-angr --num_workers 4 -output_test_dir out $DEEPSTATE/build/examples/IntegerOverflow
```

 The resulting `out` directory should look something like:

 ```
 out
└── IntegerOverflow.cpp
    ├── SignedInteger_AdditionOverflow
    │   ├── a512f8ffb2c1bb775a9779ec60b699cb.fail
    │   └── f1d3ff8443297732862df21dc4e57262.pass
    └── SignedInteger_MultiplicationOverflow
        ├── 6a1a90442b4d898cb3fac2800fef5baf.fail
        └── f1d3ff8443297732862df21dc4e57262.pass
 ```

## Usage

DeepState consists of a static library, used to write test harnesses, and command-line _executors_ written in Python. At this time, the best documentation are the [examples](/examples) and our [paper](https://www.cefns.nau.edu/~adg326/bar18.pdf).
