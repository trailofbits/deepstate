## General structure


Tests can be defined using the `TEST` macro.
This macro takes two arguments: a unit name (`PrimePolynomial`)
and a test name (`OnlyGeneratesPrimes`).

```c
#include <deepstate/DeepState.hpp>

TEST(PrimePolynomial, OnlyGeneratesPrimes) {
    ...
}

TEST(PrimePolynomial, AnotherTest) {
    ...
}
```

Each test is executed separately. If you need
a more complex setup and/or cleanup, `Test Fixtures`
can help. These are C++ classes inherited from
`deepstate:Test` that may implement two methods:
`SetUp` and `TearDown`.

To use the class just pass it as the first argument to `TEST_F` macro.

```cpp
class MyTest : public deepstate:Test {
 public:
  char* someVariable;
  symbolic_int x;

  void SetUp(void) {
    LOG(TRACE) << "Setting up!";
    someVariable = (char*)malloc(10);
  }

  void TearDown(void) {
    LOG(TRACE) << "Tearing down!";
    free(someVariable);
  }

};

TEST_F(MyTest, Something) {
  ASSUME_EQ(x, 1);
  ASSERT_NE(someVariable, 0);
}

TEST_F(MyTest, SomethingElse) {
  ASSUME_EQ(x, 3);
}
```


## Symbolic variables: Inputs

Executors need to know which variables are symbolic,
that is, which are controlled by a symbolic execution tool or fuzzer. Symbolic variables are used
as unknowns in equations during symbolic execution or populated
with "random" data by fuzzers.

There are few ways to declare symbolic variables.

#### Symbolic prefix

For basic data types you may just add `symbolic_` prefix:

```c
symbolic_unsigned x, y, z;
symbolic_char c;
symbolic_int8_t b;
```

Defined types:
* symbolic_char
* symbolic_short
* symbolic_int
* symbolic_unsigned
* symbolic_long
* symbolic_int8_t
* symbolic_uint8_t
* symbolic_int16_t
* symbolic_uint16_t
* symbolic_int32_t
* symbolic_uint32_t
* symbolic_int64_t
* symbolic_uint64_t

#### Getting symbolic values

Rather than declaring a special typed value, it is sometimes easier
(when interfacing other code, or harnesses already using `rand` etc.)
to just use the API to "ask" DeepState for a value.  DeepState defines
functions returning most types of interest:

* DeepState_Int()
* DeepState_UInt()
* DeepState_Size() (for `size_`)
* DeepState_Bool()
* DeepState_Char()
* DeepState_Float()
* DeepState_Double()

The non-boolean types also allow you to request a value in a range, a
frequent need and one not as well supported by `symbolic <type>` decls
(you can use `ASSUME` to do it, but it's much more code, and will be
far less efficient with fuzzers), e.g., `DeepState_IntInRange(low,
high)`.  DeepState ranges are inclusive.

#### Strings and bytes

To create a symbolic string you may use:

`char* DeepState_CStr_C(size_t len, const char* allowed)` which
returns a pointer to an array of symbolic chars.  The`strlen` of returned data
will always be `len`. If `allowed` is NULL, then all bytes except the
null terminator 
will be allowed, otherwise strings will be generated from the given
character alphabet.

`char* DeepState_CStrUpToLen(size_t maxLen, const char* allowed)` is the
same as `DeepState_CStr_C`, except that the length of returned string
may vary, up to `maxLen` (inclusive); the amount of memory allocated,
and the position of a null terminator, are chosen by the
fuzzer/symbolic execution tool.

`void *DeepState_Malloc(size_t num_bytes)` just
allocates `num_bytes` symbolic bytes, with arbitrary value.  **Failing to free 
this pointer will lead to a memory leak, it's just a normal pointer.**

`void *DeepState_GCMalloc(size_t num_bytes)` also
allocates `num_bytes` symbolic bytes, with arbitrary value, but
DeepState will free the pointer after the test is finished, even if
the test exits abnormally.  **Freeing THIS pointer will lead to a
double-free error.**

If you can be sure nothing you pass it to frees DeepState-allocated
memory, `DeepState_GCMalloc` is probably your best bet; it will work
much more nicely with libFuzzer and the `no_fork` option, where memory
leaks in tests are a big problem.

#### ForAll
`ForAll` 
creates temporary variables which may be used in lambda expressions.
It is declared thusly:
```cpp
template <typename... Args>
inline static void ForAll(void (*func)(Args...)) {
  func(Symbolic<Args>()...);
}

template <typename... Args, typename Closure>
inline static void ForAll(Closure func) {
  func(Symbolic<Args>()...);
}
```

A usage example is:

```cpp
ForAll<int, int>([] (int x, int y) {
  ASSERT_EQ(add(x, y), add(y, x))
      << "Addition of signed integers must commute.";
});

ForAll<std::vector<int>>([] (const std::vector<int> &vec1) {
  std::vector<int> vec2 = vec1;
  std::reverse(vec2.begin(), vec2.end());
  std::reverse(vec2.begin(), vec2.end());
  ASSERT_EQ(vec1, vec2)
      << "Double reverse of vectors must be equal.";
});
```

#### Path to input file
`const char *DeepState_InputPath(char *testcase_path)` -
returns a path to a generated file. The path may be used with standard C++ file handling
functions (like `open` and `read` etc). Useful for fuzzing (when
some API takes a path as an argument rather than raw data). This is
not useful for symbolic execution.


#### OneOf
`OneOf` is an
operator that takes as argument an arbitrary number of lambda
expressions. In each call to `OneOf`, a random lambda is choosen
and executed. This allows you to non-deterministically execute
chunks of code and apply [swarm testing](/docs/swarm_testing.md).

Example:
```cpp
TEST(OneOfTest, Basic) {
  symbolic_int data;
  ctx *context = init_some_api();

  for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i)
  {
    OneOf(
      [&context, &data, &i] {
        some_api_call(context, data, i);
      },
      [&context, &data] {
        int ret = some_other_call(context, data);
        ASSERT_EQ(ret, 0);
      }
    );
  }

  ASSERT_GT(context->smthing, 0);

  clear_context(context);
  ASSERT_EQ(context, nullptr);
}
```

You can also supply explicit probabilities to `OneOfP`, e.g.:
```cpp
OneOfP(
   0.05, [&] {x = 1; foo();},
     -1, [&] {x = 32; bar();},
   0.7, [&] {x = 128; baz();},
     -1, [&] {x = 64; foobaz();});
```

This code sets `x` to 1 and calls `foo` 5% of the time, sets x to 128 and calls `baz` 70% of the time,
sets `x` to 32 and calls `bar` 37.5% of the time, and sets `x` to 64 and calls `foobaz` 37.5% of the time.
A probability of -1 tells DeepState to assign a uniform
probability, distributed over all left-over (-1) options.  `OneOfP` does not yet support swarm testing; but you presumably
knew what you were doing when assigning probabilities!

`OneOf` and `OneOfP` can also be applied to strings, arrays, or vectors to choose a random element, e.g.,:

```cpp
const char *compressors[] = {"blosclz", "lz4", "lz4hc", "zlib", "zstd"};
compress(in_buffer, out_buffer, OneOf(compressors));
```

The `OneOfP` form can also be used for arrays or vectors, by providing the list of probabilities first, e.g.:

```cpp
const char *compressors[] = {"blosclz", "lz4", "lz4hc", "zlib", "zstd"};
compress(in_buffer, out_buffer, OneOfP({0.8, 0.001}, commpressors));
```

For this kind of `OneOfP`, in addition to the -1 method of specifying "omitted" probabilities,
you can just put the items you want to specify first in the array/vector, and only supply probabilities for those.
The example will almost always use "blocsclz" and almost never use "lz4".

## Preconditions - constraints

If you want to constrain a symbolic variable, i.e., tell the
executor that it should be less than some value, then use
`ASSUME_*` macros. These macros reduce the search space and
enhance test efficiency, and may be required to avoid invalid
inputs. Usage is simple:

```c
ASSUME_GT(x, 37);
ASSUME_NE(strncmp(y, "hmm...", 7), 0);
```

Fuzzers will abort (but won't fail) if some assumption
happen to be false, which should guide fuzzing to the
expected values.

DeepState provides following the precondition macros, in addition to
the generic `ASSUME` that takes a Boolean argument:

* ASSUME_EQ
* ASSUME_NE
* ASSUME_LT
* ASSUME_LE
* ASSUME_GT
* ASSUME_GE

## Preconditions - assign and assume

Pure assumptions are potentially highly inefficient in fuzzing.  In
fuzzing, a failed assumption simply aborts the test (there is no way
to constrain values or backtrack).  This means that a pattern like:

```
int x = DeepState_Int();
ASSUME (x % 2 == 0); // need an even value!
```

in a fuzzer, if there is much behavior prior to assigning `x`, can be
extremely inefficient, since half of all tests will abort.

To work around this, DeepState provides a what is essentially an _assigning assume_, e.g.:

```
int x;
ASSIGN_SATISFYING(x, DeepState_Int(), x % 2 == 0);
```

In symbolic execution, this simply translates into an assignment and
an assumption.  In concrete execution, however, it maps the chosen `x`
into the next (or previous) value that satisfies the predicate.  There are a few
limitations to this usage, however:

* The search is linear, since nothing else is reasonable for arbitrary
  predicates, so it may be quite costly.
* Predicates with side effects are likely to be evaluated multiple
times (the generating expression is only evaluated once, however).
* Of course all this only works for essentially integral types, where
  increment and decrement work as expected!
* The distribution is highly non-uniform.

For the last point, consider code like:

```
int x = DeepState_Int();
int y;
ASSIGN_SATISFYING(y, DeepState_Int(), y > x);
```

In fuzzing, it is highly likely that `y == x+1` and `y == MAX_INT` will result much more
often than any other relationships between `x` and `y` (one is the
result of incrementing `y`, the other of wrapping decrement).

Additionally, if you use `ASSIGN_SATISFYING` with `DeepState_<type>InRange` the
search may result in a value that is not in the range!  You can
repeat your range restriction in the predicate if you want to avoid
this problem, but an easier way around it is to use
`ASSIGN_SATISFYING_IN_RANGE`, which works just as `ASSIGN_SATISFYING`
does, except
that it also takes a range, after the generation expression, e.g.:

```
int x = DeepState_IntInRange(-10, 10);
int y;
ASSIGN_SATSIFYING_IN_RANGE(y, DeepState_IntInRange(-10, 10), -10, 10, y >= x);
```

Now `x` and `y` will both be guaranteed to fall in the range -10 to
10, inclusive.  Notice that if you pass in an initial value that violates the range
constraint, this will just cause an assumption failure, so you want to include the
range in the assignment, also.

## Postconditions - checks

Once symbolic variables are declared, constrained,
and used in functions that are tested, you may want
to assert something about the results of testing, as in normal unit
tests. To do that use either the
`ASSERT_*` or `CHECK_*` family of macros.

Macros from the first family will stop execution of the test if
the assertion is false. Macros from the second set will
mark the test as failed, but allow the test to continue.

Fuzzers will treat false `ASSERT`/`CHECK` as crashes
if the `--abort_on_fail` option is set (which is by default
when using most executors).

DeepState provides the following postcondition asserts:
* ASSERT_EQ
* ASSERT_NE
* ASSERT_LT
* ASSERT_LE
* ASSERT_GT
* ASSERT_GE
* ASSERT_TRUE
* ASSERT_FALSE

and checks:

* CHECK_EQ
* CHECK_NE
* CHECK_LT
* CHECK_LE
* CHECK_GT
* CHECK_GE
* CHECK_TRUE
* CHECK_FALSE


## Logs

Printing debug information is easy, and you can use standard `printf`-like
functions. These are reimplemented by DeepState, so they won't
introduce space state explosion (see
[the paper](https://www.trailofbits.com/reports/deepstate-bar18.pdf)). You
may also use `LOG` macros for streaming output to various logging
levels (`printf` defaults to `TRACE` level).  Setting `--min_log_level`
lets you control how much of this output DeepState shows when
replaying tests, or fuzzing.

```c
LOG(INFO) << "Hello " << name;
```

Log levels:
* DEBUG
* TRACE
* INFO
* WARNING
* WARN
* ERROR
* FATAL
* CRITICAL
