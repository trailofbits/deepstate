Repository for GenTest, a Northern Arizona University capstone team.

## Northern Arizona University Capstone
This project is being developed by team GenTest. The Team members and roles are as follows:
* Team Lead/Editor - Joshua Johnson
* Recorder - Silu Shen
* Architect - Tristan Miller
* Coder - Zane Fink

All team members are also "coders" and are expected to develop GenTest


## Purpose:
The purpose of GenTest is to utilize [DeepState](https://github.com/trailofbits/deepstate)
 and create a standalone test. This standalone test will allow for the reuse of generated values
 as well as running tests generated by DeepState without requiring DeepState itself.
 
## Build Instructions
Currently this is the standalone module without deepstate integration

1. Set the current directory to the working directory for GenTest

`mkdir build && cd build`

`cmake ..`

`make`

## Usage

`./GenTest [harness file] [binary file] [output location/file name] [configuration file]`

An example for a harness, binary file, and configuration can be found in the test/test_data folder. 
Currently gtestTranslation.cfg works for google test, however translations of ASSERT, CHECK, and ASSUME is not being performed.
This is fine as googletest uses the same conventions as deepstate.
